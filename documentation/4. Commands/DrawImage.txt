.SetVar CommandSubHeading Other
.Do CommandSubHeading
.SetVar CommandLine1 The variable _LastResult is set to '0' if there were any issues with the parameters
.SetVar CommandLine1 %CommandLine1% provided, or if the image will not fit within the margins, otherwise it is set to '1'.
.Do CommandLine
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 There are a number of combinations of width, height and scaling factor that provide
.SetVar CommandLine1 %CommandLine1% flexibility in the size of the image that is rendered in the document:
.Do CommandLine
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 -
.SetVar CommandLine1b If none of the width, height or scale parameters are given, or are zero, 
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% then the image will be rendered using the dimensions of the image. 
.Do CommandLine2
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 -
.SetVar CommandLine1b If the width is given, and is not zero, and both the height and scale are not given or are zero,
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% then the height of the image is proportionally scaled. 
.Do CommandLine2
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 -
.SetVar CommandLine1b If the height is given, and is not zero, and both the width and scale are not given or are zero,
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% then the width of the image is proportionally scaled. 
.Do CommandLine2
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 -
.SetVar CommandLine1b If the width or height is given, or both, and the scale is not given or is zero,
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% then the dimensions of the image will be calculated as either the 
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% provided dimension or the image dimension.
.Do CommandLine2
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%
.SetVar CommandLine1 -
.SetVar CommandLine1b If the width or height is given, or both, and the scale is given,
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% then the dimensions of the image will be calculated as either the 
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% provided dimension or the image dimension. These dimensions
.SetVar CommandLine1b %CommandLine1b% will then be scaled by multiplying by the scaling factor.
.Do CommandLine2
