.SetVar ChapterName Introduction
.do ChapterHeading
.SetVar text jsPdf-Dynamo is a wrapper around the open-source JavaScript PDF generation library, jsPDF.
.SetVar text %text% Using a template driven approach, it enables the separation of layout and formatting logic
.SetVar text %text% from the placement of data.

.incCurrentY  %_FONTHEIGHT%

.SetVar text jsPdf-Dynamo can be used with browser or NodeJs applications written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

.DrawText 0 %_CurrentY% Advantages of using jsPdf-Dynamo include:
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar width %_PageWidth%
.IncVar width -10
.SetVar text The separation of layout and formatting logic from the placement of data. As a page is
.SetVar text %text% filled with data, jsPdf-Dynamo can insert new pages, with appropriate headings,
.SetVar text %text% footings, and bookmarks as required.

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text The ability to store corporate and application wide format settings in templates 
.SetVar text %text% that can be maintained independently from the application.
.SetVar text %text% This is similar to the use of style sheets in web applications to enable 
.SetVar text %text% visual consistency, reduce errors and minimise maintenance costs. These format settings
.SetVar text %text% can include colours, font styles and sizes, page headings, and more.

.DrawText 0 %_CurrentY% There are a few basic concepts to be aware of when using jsPdf-Dynamo:
.incCurrentY %halfLineGap%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text The functionality of jsPdf-Dynamo is implemented through the JsPdfDynamo class.
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text The initial page size, orientation and units of measure are set when the
.SetVar text %text% JsPdfDynamo instance is instantiated.
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text Output is driven by a series of plain text 'commands'. These
.SetVar text %text% commands can be provided as a list of strings from multiple sources, 
.SetVar text %text% including the JavaScript or TypeScript application, or loaded from
.SetVar text %text% 'templates' retrieved from a URL (browser only) or from local text 
.SetVar text %text% files (NodeJs only).
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text Positions are specified relative to the left and top margin. The exception to this are
.SetVar text %text% margins which are measured from the appropriate edge of the page.
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text All measurements and positions are in the unit of measure specified
.SetVar text %text% when the instance of JsPdfDynamo is created. This can be millimeters, inches,
.SetVar text %text% or points. The exception to this are fonts, which are always specified in points.
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.DrawText 10 %top% A series of commands can be grouped and named. These groups of commands can then 
.DrawText 10 %_CurrentY% be processed one or more times. This is a similar concept to methods or procedures
.DrawText 10 %_CurrentY% in more sophisticated computer languages. 

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text All commands, command group names and variable names are case insensitive.
.DrawTextWrapped 10 %top% %width% *None %text%

.SetVar top %_CurrentY%
.DrawText 5 %top% -
.SetVar text There are two kinds of variables, user variables and system maintained variables.
.SetVar text %text% User variables can be created and modified as required using script commands. 
.SetVar text %text% As the name implies, system maintained variables are created and maintained and
.SetVar text %text% cannot be directly modified directly by script commands.
